// In the prep, we implemented a function to parse query strings.
// Unfortunately, it contains several bugs!
// Below is one test case for an edge case the implementation doesn't handle well.
// Fix the implementation for this test, and try to think of as many other edge cases as possible - write tests and fix those too.
